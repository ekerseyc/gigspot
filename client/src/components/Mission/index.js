        Everyone knows that to be a musician, you have to go through the phase of trial and tribulation that engenders the voicings and sounds that will shape your career. Even if you want to jam with your friends when you're free, finding that gas money can be hardâ€¦ With Gig Spot, we bring talented gig workers and people in search of skilled folk to make sure everyone is happy at the end of the day! No more stress over who is going to capture all the idyllic moments at your wedding; the normal band can't make it anymore? No problem!
